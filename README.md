# Information Retrieval Project - News Verification System

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a system to verify the authenticity of news using large language models (LLMs), specifically targeting Singaporean news. The primary tool is the Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) model, combining traditional information retrieval with advanced language processing.

## Highlights
- **Objective**: Combat the spread of fake news by accurately verifying news content.
- **Methodology**: Utilizes RAG model and the Haystack framework, with a specific focus on local Singaporean news.
- **Dataset**: Articles from The Straits Times, obtained through web scraping.
- **Techniques**: Implementation of BM25, dense embeddings, and TF-IDF retrievers.
- **Evaluation**: System assessed through BLEU score, BERTScore, and LLM verification metrics.
- **Results**: Significant improvement in news verification accuracy with the implementation of various RAG methods.
- **Limitations**: Project scope limited to Singaporean news sources; challenges in tackling sophisticated misinformation.
- **Future Directions**: Enhancing retriever accuracy and effectiveness; expanding scope to global news sources.
